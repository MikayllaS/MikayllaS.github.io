         <p>"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one." 
            I have used this phrase to describe myself for many years. At work, with friends, I am never known for 
            being good at one specific thing. I like to learn knew things and be helpful in any way possible. There are things
            I am better at and things I am average or even terrible at. At the end of the day its hard to narrow down one or two 
            hobbies or interests. I decided to make this site about me just as I am. I titled it Off Canvas Design because my 
            biggest hobby/interest, what I went to school for is Graphic Design. One of the things I like about graphic design is that
            anything can be a canvas. From small posts on social media to large billboards on the side of the highway. Your canvas is wherever
            you want it to be.</p>
